## Technology Stack

### Django

A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications. Django provides built-in features for authentication, database ORM, and admin interface, making it ideal for building the backend API.

### PostgreSQL/MySQL

Relational database management systems that store and manage application data. These databases provide ACID compliance, complex querying capabilities, and excellent performance for handling user data, property listings, and booking information.

### GraphQL

A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. GraphQL provides flexibility in data fetching, reduces over-fetching, and enables efficient communication between frontend and backend.

### React.js

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with component-based architecture. React enables the creation of dynamic, responsive frontend applications with efficient state management and reusable components.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between parties for secure authentication. JWT tokens enable stateless authentication, allowing users to securely access protected resources without server-side session storage.

### Docker

A containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into portable containers. Docker ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments while simplifying deployment processes.

### GitHub Actions

A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that automates testing, building, and deployment workflows. GitHub Actions enables automated code quality checks, testing, and seamless deployment to production environments.

- **Relationships**: One-to-one with Bookings

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Comprehensive user authentication and profile management system that allows users to register, login, and manage their personal information. This feature includes email verification, password reset functionality, and user role management (guest vs host), providing a secure foundation for all user interactions.

### Property Management

Complete property listing and management system enabling hosts to add, edit, and manage their rental properties. This includes property details, photo uploads, availability calendars, pricing management, and property status controls, giving hosts full control over their listings.

### Booking System

Robust reservation management system that handles the entire booking lifecycle from search to completion. Features include real-time availability checking, booking confirmation, payment processing integration, and booking modification capabilities, ensuring smooth transactions between guests and hosts.

### Search and Filtering

Advanced search functionality that allows users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. The system includes map-based search, filtering options, and sorting capabilities to help users quickly find their ideal accommodations.

### Review and Rating System

Comprehensive feedback system enabling guests and hosts to rate and review each other after completed stays. This feature builds trust within the platform by providing transparency and accountability, helping future users make informed decisions.

### Payment Integration

Secure payment processing system that handles transactions between guests and hosts. The system supports multiple payment methods, automatic payout scheduling, and transaction history tracking while ensuring PCI compliance and data security.

## API Security

### Authentication

Implementation of robust authentication mechanisms using JWT tokens to verify user identity and maintain secure sessions. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures that only authenticated users can perform actions like booking properties or managing listings.

### Authorization

Role-based access control system that ensures users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role and ownership. This prevents unauthorized users from modifying other users' data, accessing private information, or performing administrative actions.

### Rate Limiting

Protection against abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per user within specified time windows. This ensures fair resource usage, prevents system overload, and protects against malicious automated attacks while maintaining good performance for legitimate users.

### Data Validation

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities. All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious code execution.

### HTTPS Encryption

All data transmission between clients and servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols to protect sensitive information like passwords, payment details, and personal data from interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## CI/CD Pipeline
